Developed primarily for FreeBSD currently.

Usage:
  ./drvtool [<options>] [<device> [<actions>]]

Options:
  -h               Display this information
  -V               Print program verson and exit
  -v               Increase verbosity
  -w               Open device in R/W mode (needed for write tests)
  -y               Answer yes to all questions
  -r               Reverse block order
  -f               Flush device write buffer
  -d               Enable sending TRIM commands to device
  -p               Print last block
  -R <size>        Enable Shuffled (size of deck)/Random (size 0) order
  -X <type>        Transform type (XOR, ROL, ROR) [NONE]
  -D <type>        Digest (checksum) type (CRC32, ADLER32, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512) [NONE]
  -T <time>        Test time limit [NONE]
  -P <num>         Number of passes [1]
  -S <pos>         Starting block offset [FIRST]
  -L <size>        Number of blocks [ALL]
  -B <size>        Block size [NATIVE]

Actions:
  read             Read-only test [doesn't harm OS]
  refresh          Read+Rewrite test [doesn't harm data]
  verify           Read+Rewrite+Read test [doesn't harm data]
  test             Read+Write+Read+Restore pattern test [doesn't harm data]
  write            Write-only pattern test [corrupts data]
  compare          Write+Read pattern test [corrupts data]
  purge            Multi-pass Write+Read NCSC-TG-025/DoD 5220.22-M purge [corrupts data]
  delete           Send device TRIM commands [corrupts data]

Notes:

  - Beware of using any of the write tests on SSD devices. Due
    to the way they operate (with remapping of blocks for wear levelling)
    you will not test what you intend and instead just make them fail faster.
    
  - Beware that the Shuffle (-R) option allocates a lot of RAM, typically
    8 bytes times the number of blocks requested - but it guarantees that
    all blocks in the requested range will be visited.
